										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-14037 alignnone" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DevOps-vs-DevSecOps-Which-Amplify-Automation-and-Security.jpg" alt="DevOps vs DevSecOps: Which Amplify Automation and Security" width="800" height="422" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DevOps-vs-DevSecOps-Which-Amplify-Automation-and-Security.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DevOps-vs-DevSecOps-Which-Amplify-Automation-and-Security-300x158.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DevOps-vs-DevSecOps-Which-Amplify-Automation-and-Security-768x405.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>In today&#8217;s IT world, most software pros are willing to adopt the agile framework in the current market. As a result, the focus has shifted from transforming the process to prioritizing the roles. Agile spawned off multiple methodologies such as <strong>DevOps</strong>, SecOps, and <strong>DevSecOps</strong>. For instance, DevOps decreases the delivery time, whereas SecOps creates security, and DevSecOps create a balance between the two.</p>
<p>In recent years, <strong>DevOps and DevSecOps</strong> have transformed many companies&#8217; software development approaches. But both terms have become a euphemism for software development. At the same time, it is essential to understand the importance of both DevOps and DevSecOps concepts. They are not permanent paradigms, monolithic, or one-size-fits-all.</p>
<p>Both DevOps and DevSecOps sound similar terms. But their distinctions can impact your business effectiveness and the IT industry on a larger scale. Understanding the concepts will allow you to develop a productive work for your company&#8217;s data by leveraging the weakness and strengths of each model.</p>
<p>The two terms DevOps and DevSecOps are perceived to be synonymous with each other. However, some industry experts suggest that DevSecOps isn&#8217;t only compatible with DevOps but also vital for it to function optimally in a few circumstances.</p>
<p>Teams who understand the differences of <strong>DevOps Vs DevSecOps</strong> can make decisions that will improve the productivity of their app development pipeline. It also helps teams to make modifications to their process so that they may focus more on security, agility, and speed.</p>
<p>So, let’s dive into understanding these approaches and how they differ from each other.</p>
<h2>DevOps</h2>
<p>Patricks Debois coined the term <strong>DevOps</strong> in 2007. He is known as the father of DevOps. He was an IT consultant who used agile methodologies to bridge the gap between project management and operations.</p>
<p>DevOps is a set of tools, practices, and a philosophy that automates and combine the process between software development and IT teams. It defines a change in IT culture to improve work throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC).</p>
<p>The development and operations teams are not the same as twins under the DevOps approach. Instead, these two teams combine a single group where developers work on the application lifecycle, from deployment to development test. As a result, they foster a broad range of skills that aren’t limited to a single function.</p>
<blockquote><p>Transposit IT firm released the ‘2022 State of DevOps Automation&#8217; report and said IT firms adopted DevOps workflow more widely. 48.2 percent of IT pros pointed to automation, while 52.3 percent of IT pros stated that they would run new automation tools.</p></blockquote>
<p>Security is a priority in the <strong>DevOps</strong> approach. As a result, the security team and quality assurance teams collaborate throughout the application lifecycle. They depend on a technology stack and tools to guide them to produce applications consistently and quickly.</p>

<h3>DevOps Benefits</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-14047 alignnone" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devops-1.jpg" alt="Benefits of DevOps" width="800" height="604" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devops-1.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devops-1-300x227.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devops-1-768x580.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>DevOps has multiple benefits that a company can have productive work after <a href="../../implementation-strategy-tools-collaboration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implementing the DevOps</a> model in their workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Below mentioned are some of the benefits of DevOps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Faster deployment</li>
<li>Improvement in product quality</li>
<li>Continuous delivery of software</li>
<li>Fast resolution of problems</li>
<li>Less complexity to manage</li>
<li>Fast delivery features</li>
<li>More time for innovation</li>
<li>Client satisfaction</li>
<li>Agility</li>
<li>Speed</li>
</ul>
<h3>DevOps Practices</h3>
<p>Continuous automation and improvement are essential to DevOps practices. As a result, many practices concentrate on one or more levels of the development cycle. These are some of the practices</p>
<h3>Continuous Development</h3>
<p>The coding and planning phases of the DevOps lifecycle involve in this approach. In addition, it may involve version control techniques.</p>
<h3>Continuous Testing</h3>
<p>Continuous testing includes ongoing code tests, automation, and prescheduling of the application code to modify. Such tests can help to expedite code release to the production atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>It entails feedback between development and testing to discover and resolve code errors as quickly as possible. In addition, this method involves configuration management (CM) tools with other development tools to track how much code is ready for production.</p>
<h3>Continuous Delivery</h3>
<p>It automates the delivery of code changes to a preproduction stage after testing. A staff member may then opt to push such code changes into production.</p>
<h3>Continuous Deployment</h3>
<p>It automates the release of new or updated code into production, similar to continuous delivery. Continuous deployment allows an organization to release code or feature updates numerous times.</p>
<h3>Continuous Monitoring</h3>
<p>This method entails continuous monitoring of the infrastructure. A feedback loop in which bugs or problems are reported and reported to development.</p>
<h3>Infrastructure as Code</h3>
<p>Infrastructure as code uses to automate the provisioning of infrastructure required for a software release during multiple DevOps processes. Developers developed Infrastructure &#8220;code&#8221; using their existing development tools.</p>
<h2>DevSecOps</h2>
<p>DevSecOps is a short form of development, security, and operations. It automates the security at every stage of the <strong>SDLC</strong>. It is a way to reach IT security with everyone responsible for a security mindset. The aim is to involve security at every level of the software development workflow.</p>
<p>If your company has adopted DevOps, then it&#8217;s an excellent thought to shift towards <strong>DevSecOps</strong>. It depends on the principle of DevOps, which will enable the user to bring IT pros from technical disciplines to allow your existing security processes.</p>
<blockquote><p>A CSA survey said that 30 percent of IT security pros are adopting the DevSecOps model. While 24 percent of companies are in the planning phase, 18 percent are in the designing phase, and 90 percent of companies are at some stage of their DevSecOps journey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Applying security at every stage of the SDLC allows software products to deliver more quickly. In addition, it reduces the costs and continuous integration. In <strong>DevSecOps</strong>, every person and team is responsible for security. And they must make quick decisions and adopt them without compromising security.</p>

<h3>Benefits of DevSecOps</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-14048 alignnone" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devsecops.jpg" alt="Benefits of DevSecOps" width="800" height="680" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devsecops.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devsecops-300x255.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devsecops-768x653.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The two key advantages of DevSecOps are security and speed. Development teams produce cheaper, better, and more secure code.</p>
<p><strong>There are multiple advantages of adopting DevSecOps, and some of them are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase in the delivery rate and expense reductions</li>
<li>Deployment check, monitoring, a notification mechanism, and security have been in place from the outset</li>
<li>It fosters exposure and transparency from the starting stages of the development process</li>
<li>The capacity to secure and measure through design</li>
<li>Improving overall security through the use of immutable infrastructure</li>
<li>In the case of a security breach, recovery time is bettered</li>
<li>The use of template methods improves the speed of recovery in the case of a security problem</li>
</ul>

<h3>DevSecOps Practices</h3>
<p>The human aspect will always be the weakest link in the chain, yet of how many technologies you choose to combine. However, it is the start point for any <a href="../../devsecops-services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevSecOps adoption</a>. One of the essential factors of DevSecOps is that it challenges traditional security teams&#8217; integration with the rest of the business.</p>
<p>Let’s go through some of the specific <a href="../what-are-the-best-devsecops-practices-for-security-and-balance-agility/what-are-the-best-devsecops-practices-for-security-and-balance-agility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevSecOps practices</a></p>
<h3>Encrypt Sensitive Data</h3>
<p>Any data that could harm or identify an individual, both at transit and in rest, should encrypt. It includes medical records, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.</p>
<h3>Make Your Application Development Process More Secure</h3>
<p>The starting step to secure your DevOps process is to assure the security of your application development process. It involves limiting access to your code repositories to authorized developers. It ensures all code changes to evaluate and approved by a qualified reviewer before merging into the main branch.</p>
<h3>Protect Your Production Environment</h3>
<p>Your application will deploy and use by your clients in your production pro. As a result, it&#8217;s essential to make sure this process is more secure.</p>
<h3>Use Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
<p>Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) is a security measure that safeguards access to DevOps resources. A user must supply two components of evidence to validate their identity with 2FA. The first component is something they know, such as a password. At the same time, the second component is something they possess, such as a mobile phone.</p>
<h3>Operate Secret Management Tools</h3>
<p>Secret management tools can let you handle secrets from a central location while providing access control and auditing. AWS Secrets Manager and Hashicorp’s Vault are the most famous secret management tools available in the market.</p>
<h3>Perform Regular Security Audits</h3>
<p>Security audits should be performed regularly as part of <a href="../devops-security-an-overview-of-challenges-and-best-practices/devops-security-an-overview-of-challenges-and-best-practices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps security</a>. It may help you identify system flaws and make sure that your security policies are effective.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts on DevOps Vs DevSecOps</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t Devops Vs DevSecOps, as both approaches have the most common features. It includes automation and continual processes to generate shared development cycles. DevOps emphasizes delivery speed, while DevSecOps emphasizes more security. Although DevOps and DevSecOps concepts are not mutually exclusive, their objectives are distinct.</p>
<p>Instead of picking DevOps Vs DevSecOps, opt for multiple approaches. Which gives you multiple benefits for your business.

<p>In today’s IT world, few companies have yet to figure out how to secure the cloud effectively. As a result, a shortage of <a href="../cloud-security-automation-best-practices-strategy-and-benefits/cloud-security-automation-best-practices-strategy-and-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud security</a> knowledge and legacy security regulations that do not cover the cloud.</p>
<p>Security must adopt at every stage of the DevOps life cycle, known as <strong>DevSecOps</strong>. A company that runs cloud technology should adopt the <a href="../continuous-integration-the-devops-approach-which-fuels-productivity/continuous-integration-the-devops-approach-which-fuels-productivity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevSecOps approach</a>. It requires policies, procedures, and new security guidelines.</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2027, the global DevSecOps industry will have grown ninefold, to more than USD 17 billion, up from just over USD 2 billion in 2019.“</p></blockquote>
<p>Users who have a substantial exposure to the world of app and software development, then they are familiar with DevOps. But do they have any idea about the concept of DevSecOps? The combination of DevOps and security is DevSecOps.</p>
<p>Before going in-depth about the topic. Let’s explore the concepts first. What is DevSecOps? Why is DevSecOps important, adopting and measures?</p>
<h2>What is DevSecOps?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14007 size-full" title="What is DevSecOps" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-devsecops.jpg" alt="What is DevSecOps" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-devsecops.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-devsecops-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-devsecops-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>DevSecOps is a security issue for the development team and operations team. It’s an automation, culture, and platform design model that involves security as a shared responsibility through the IT life cycle. It is an application security (AppSec) technique involving security in the software development life cycle (SDLC).</p>
<p>DevSecOps should include security across the SDLC so that DevOps teams can deliver secure apps quickly and with high quality. In addition, CI/CD workflow, such as testing and risk mitigation, reduces the time-consuming and expensive consequences of making patches post-production.</p>
<p>DevSecOps has always been ideal to build security as an integral part of their app life cycle. DevSecOps means built-in security into application development from start to end. It is an important evolution in how development companies approach security.</p>
<p>With real-time monitoring of loops and insights, DevSecOps spans the whole SDLC. From planning and design to coding.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Useful link: <a href="../../devsecops-services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevSecOps Process, Benefits, Tools and Implementation</a></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>To adopt DevSecOps, teams should follow the below steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To reduce software code attacks, include security throughout the SLDC.</li>
<li>Assign some security practices to the DevOps team.</li>
<li>Allow automatic security checks at each stage of the SLDC to combine tools, processes, and security controls through the DevOps workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security should apply at each stage of the DevOps pipeline, including plan, code, build, test, release, and deploy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14005 size-full" title="DevSecOps Pipeline" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/devsecops-pipeline.jpg" alt="DevSecOps Pipeline" width="801" height="500" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/devsecops-pipeline.jpg 801w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/devsecops-pipeline-300x187.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/devsecops-pipeline-768x479.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></p>
<h3>Plan</h3>
<p>DevSecOps plan stage is the least automated, comprising discussion, review, collaboration, and strategy of security analysis approach.  Teams should execute a security analysis and develop a plan outlining where, how, and when security testing will happen.</p>
<p>IriusRisk tool is the most DevSecOps plan tool and is a collaborative design tool for threat models. Jira tool is for issue tracking and management. The slack tool is for software, communication, and chat platforms. All these tools use as add-ons.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>Developers can run DevSecOps in the code phase to guide them write better secure programs. Code-phase security practices include pre-commit hooks, static code analysis, and code reviews.</p>
<p>Security technologies involve in developers’ existing Git workflow. When a security test automates triggers every commit and merge. It even supports combined development and programming languages. Security code tools such as CheckStyle, PMD, Gerrit, Phabricator, Find Security Bugs, and SpotBugs are the most popular.</p>
<h3>Build</h3>
<p>The build process starts when developers add code to the source repository. It aims to create tools to automate the security analysis of build output artifacts. Security approaches include unit tests, software component analysis, and static application software testing (SAST). In addition, it can add tools to an existing <a href="../ci-cd-pipeline-15-best-practices-for-successful-test-automation/ci-cd-pipeline-15-best-practices-for-successful-test-automation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI/CD pipeline</a> to automate these tests.</p>
<p>Checkmarx, SourceClear, OWASP Dependency-Check, SonarQube, Snyk, and Retire.js is for the build phase tools.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Test</h3>
<p>The test phase starts after a build artifact is built and deployed to testing conditions or staging. Executing a complete test suite requires a significant amount of time. Therefore, this phase should fail quickly to complete the more costly test jobs later.</p>
<p>During the test phase, DAST tools used to detect actual application flows such as SQL injection, authorization, user authentication, API-related endpoints, and SQL injection. There are multiple paid testing and open-source tools available in the current market, including Gauntlt, Arachi, Boofuzz, JBroFuzz, BDD Automated Security Tests, Owasp Zap, SecApp suite, and IBM AppScan.</p>
<h3>Release</h3>
<p>Test the application and executable code when the DevSecOps cycle reaches the release phase. The phase explores the configuration variables such as network firewall access, personal data management, and user access control to secure the runtime architecture.</p>
<p>Configuration management technologies are essential for security during the release phase. It allows visibility into the static configuration of a dynamic environment. <a href="../../services/terraform/terraform.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform</a>, <a href="../../chef-vs-puppet-vs-ansible-comparison-of-devops-management-tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppet, Chef, Ansible</a>, and <a href="../../services/docker/docker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a> are configuration management tools.</p>
<h3>Deploy</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s time to deploy the build artifact to production if the preceding phases were successful. The only security issues to address during the deployment phase are against the live production system. Production TLS and DRM certificates should be checked and assessed for impending renewal.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Why is DevSecOps becoming essential?</h3>
<p>DevSecOps combines security into the SDLC earlier. As a result, it is easy and less expensive to discover the patch vulnerabilities before they go too far into production. When development groups code with security from the start. In addition, companies with multiple industries can adopt DevSecOps to break through boundaries between development, security, and operations. It allows them to deploy more secure software faster.</p>
<p>Companies might ignore security measures for speed, but this is an experiment that could backfire disastrously. Do you want to experiment with jeopardizing your latest app launch, especially if the launch&#8217;s success is critical to your company&#8217;s survival? Then there&#8217;s the possibility that a slew of security concerns emerge after the product is released, resulting in an army of irate, disgruntled customers, many of whom will abandon your product and organization.</p>
<p>IT security is a significant concern in today&#8217;s digital world, and the threats aren&#8217;t going away anytime soon. Cyber-attacks and fraud are becoming more common. With this harsh reality in mind, it&#8217;s impossible to see any enterprise today ignoring the security part of the DevOps process.</p>

<hr />
<h4>Challenges of DevOps security</h4>
<ul>
<li>Security observes as a problem by DevOps teams</li>
<li>IT security teams are unable to keep up with DevOps&#8217; speed</li>
<li>Most inexperienced tools and open sources have security flaws</li>
<li>More attack opportunities emerge as a result of inadequately managed privileged access controls</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adopting DevSecOps measures</h2>
<p>To successfully adopt DevSecOps in a strategy summed up as &#8220;moving security focus to the left,&#8221; the team must ensure that security embeds into the program development from starting to end. Below mentioned are five crucial components of any DevSecOps model are:</p>
<h3>Compliance monitoring</h3>
<p>Stay compliant at all times to be ready for an audit. Integrated compliance monitoring provides a framework for accomplishing. It allows teams to work more quickly while maintaining traceability and more reliable controls.</p>
<h3>Code analysis</h3>
<p>Deliver code in small chunks to make it easy to discover faults quickly. Of course, the business will always need to perform code analysis. First, however, the functionality must be ingrained into the tooling that developers use while pushing, merging, pulling, writing, and integrating lines of code.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Change management</h3>
<p>Any team can submit changes, then decide whether the change benefits or troubles the team. Change management is associated with bureaucracy in IT businesses.</p>
<h3>Threat investigation</h3>
<p>Identify threats as they emerge in each code to change and update quickly. Threat investigation is one of the crucial security practices used to guide and visualize the potential of something awful.</p>

<p>More development teams modernize their processes and use new tools; they must maintain a high level of security. It is a cyclical process that should regularly be iterated and applied to new code deployments. Hackers and exploits constantly change; thus, modern software teams must keep up.</p>
<p>Moreover, Enterprises will adopt DevSecOps to a greater extent as the process becomes more automated. DevSecOps deployment becomes a no-brainer when automation is combined with high security.</p>

<p>When a new concept emerges in software development, companies are increasingly adopt methodologies that allow dependable and scalable software. For the past few years, two concepts have been trending in the IT arena &#8211; <strong>DevOps </strong>and <strong>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)</strong>. They both coexisted in the field of software development and deployment.</p>
<p>Both these may appear to be competitors at first glance. However, deep insights revealed that alleged competitors have distinct processes and identities to meet the requisite goals. Moreover, they both are different words for the same approach. Both <strong>Site Reliability Engineering</strong> <strong>(SRE)</strong> and <strong>DevOps</strong> aim to bridge the gap between development and operations teams to improve the life cycle without compromising quality. For past few years, the rise of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering approaches and practices have become mainstream.</p>
<p>Dynatrace, the software intelligence platform, revealed that 88 percent of SREs respondents expressed their opinion that they know an in-depth understanding of the strategic importance of their role right now than it was three years ago. 99 percent of SREs respondents said they encountered challenges when creating and designing SLOs to evaluate service levels for infrastructure and applications. 85 % of SREs respondents said they need to run the same observability platform from development to operations and security by 2025.</p>
<p>Another survey conducted by Transposit firm on National DevOps day stated that two-thirds of respondents (63 percent) had noticed a rapid growth in service incidents after affecting their clients during the last 14 months. Furthermore, coming to the DevOps workflow, over half of respondents (58 percent) said that downtime for their company could be up to USD 4,99,999 per hour on average, with 40 % informed that the cost increased in the previous year.</p>

<p>Before delving deep into the significant difference between <strong>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)</strong> and <strong>DevOps</strong>, let’s explore the concepts first.</p>
<h2>What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13989 size-full" title="What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre.jpg" alt="What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre-300x188.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-site-reliability-engineering-sre-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The concept of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) was first originated at Google in 2003 under the direction of Ben Treynor Sloss, vice president and overseeing technical operations at Google. In recent times, SRE has gained much traction in the IT world.</p>
<blockquote><p>Google’s vice president Treynor Sloss said, “So SRE is fundamentally doing work that has historically been done by an operations team, but using engineers with software expertise, and banking on the fact that these engineers are inherently both predisposed to, and have the ability to, substitute automation for human labor.”</p></blockquote>
<p>SRE is the result of combining system operations responsibilities such as latency, performance, ensuring availability, scalability, capacity, and the deployment of software systems. By combining various aspects of software development into IT operations, SRE offers a unique model for service management and application life cycle.</p>
<p>SRE measures a system&#8217;s performance using three Service Level Commitments.</p>
<h4>1) Service level agreements (SLAs)</h4>
<p>SLA is a documented agreement between a client and a service provider, mainly what services a service provider will offer and the standard.</p>
<h4>2) Service level objectives (SLOs)</h4>
<p>Service level objectives (SLOs) cater to values and goals created by SRE teams that must reach to meet SLAs.</p>
<h4>3) Service level indicators (SLIs)</h4>
<p>SLIs are metrics and attributes that show how well a system complies with SLOs. Typical SLIs include development frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR), system throughput, request latency, lead time, and availability error rate.</p>

<h3>Benefits of SRE</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13981 size-full" title="Benefits of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-sre.jpg" alt="Benefits of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)" width="800" height="488" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-sre.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-sre-300x183.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-sre-768x468.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Whereas DevOps improves company collaboration and speed, one of the primary benefits of SRE is increased uptime. Their focus is primarily on service operational or software platforms. SRE aims to keep things operational, and tasks such as prevention, reliability, redundancy, and disaster management are paramount.</p>
<p>The goal of the SRE team is to figure out the best solutions to avoid issues that could result in downtime and keep things running. This is especially key for managing large-scale systems. The significant advantage of Site Reliability Engineering is that it allows businesses to minimize manual tasks, providing developers more time to create innovative ways. Moreover, in SRE, any flaws are swiftly identified and rectified efficiently.</p>
<h3>Roles and responsibilities of SRE</h3>
<p>The purpose of <strong>SRE</strong> in an organization is quite simple – the SRE team ensures that the service or platform is available to clients whenever they require it. In addition, through the refinement and automation of routine processes, an SRE ensures seamless collaboration between development teams and <a href="../../solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT operations</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Some responsibilities of an SRE include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Software development, configuration, and deployment for operations teams</li>
<li>Taking care of escalation flaws in support</li>
<li>Reviewing incidents and reporting on them</li>
<li>Creating documentation for the system</li>
<li>Management changes</li>
<li>Approving and determining new features, enhancements and developing system documentation.</li>
<li>SRE enables developers to develop more dependable systems by focusing on development and operations. As a result, the developers have a far better perspective for supporting production systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13986 size-full" title="What is DevOps?" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-devops.jpg" alt="What is DevOps?" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-devops.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-devops-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-devops-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The concept of DevOps was coined by Andrew Clay and Patrick Debois in 2008. The DevOps movement began to coalesce during 2007 and 2008 when software development teams and IT operations teams had raised issues about what they witnessed as a terminal degree of dysfunction in the industry.</p>
<p><a href="../devops-made-easier-with-devops-tools/made-easier-with-devops-tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps combines tools</a>, practices, and cultural philosophy that improve work throughout the implementation of lean practices, and agile in the context of a system-oriented model. Simply, it is an approach to software development. Developers or programmers were responsible for developing and coding the required functionality in the traditional software development lifecycle. It is a combination of practices and concepts related to software delivery and development. DevOps also permits improved customer satisfaction and reliable service delivery by providing collaboration and communication between cross-functional teams.</p>
<h3>DevOps methods and practices</h3>
<p>Continuous, incremental improvements are the foundation of <a href="../devops-managed-services-tap-the-true-potential-of-your-devops-transformation/devops.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps processes</a>, which are aided by automation. While full automation is rarely attainable, a <strong>DevOps methodology</strong> focuses on the following factors for total automation:</p>
<h3>Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13982 size-full" title="Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-cicd.jpg" alt="Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-cicd.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-cicd-300x188.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-cicd-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The goal of DevOps is to update and deliver apps to clients as quickly as possible. DevOps automates releasing and updating code into production using <a href="../../ci-cd-services-integrate-and-automate-devops.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI/CD pipelines</a> to connect procedures and processes.</p>
<p>Continuous monitoring and deployment are also part of CI/CD to maintain code consistency across multiple software versions and deployment environments.</p>
<h3>Infrastructure as code</h3>
<p>DevOps emphasizes the abstraction of <a href="../../it-infrastructure-services-no-more-a-concern-with-veritis-consulting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT infrastructure</a> so that it may be provisioned and controlled automatically using software engineering methodologies. Consequently, you&#8217;ll have an efficient system that permits your team to monitor infrastructure configurations and track changes that have unanticipated or undesirable consequences that should roll back.</p>
<h3>Automated testing</h3>
<p>While updating or writing the code, it is continuously and automatically tested. The continuous mechanism accelerates deployment by eliminating bottlenecks associated with pre-release testing.</p>

<h3>Benefits of DevOps</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13980 size-full" title="Benefits of DevOps" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devops.jpg" alt="Benefits of DevOps" width="800" height="485" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devops.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devops-300x182.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-devops-768x466.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>DevOps decreases the complexity of managing software engineering projects through automation and collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>The following are some of the benefits of implementing DevOps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By making few modifications and frequent delivery of application features, DevOps speeds up software delivery.</li>
<li>Create a balanced approach to managing Software Development Life Cycle (SLDC) to increase software team productivity.</li>
<li>Fixes and updates are also simpler and faster, and the software’s stability has been enhanced.</li>
<li>Vast software was split into services or microservices to make replacements and updates easy and fast.</li>
<li>Reduce production costs by eliminating infrastructure management and maintenance errors.</li>
<li>DevOps also enhances software stability because while changes are regularly pushed to production, they are minimal and have a lower risk of causing the interruption.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Difference between SRE and DevOps</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13983 size-full" title="Difference Between SRE and DevOps" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/difference-between-sre-and-devops.jpg" alt="Difference Between SRE and DevOps" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/difference-between-sre-and-devops.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/difference-between-sre-and-devops-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/difference-between-sre-and-devops-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<h3>Final Thoughts on <strong>Site Reliability Engineering (</strong>SRE) and DevOps</h3>
<p>DevOps and SRE are considered two parts of the same thing, with SRE techniques and tooling complementing DevOps practices and philosophies. Although, most organizations have already <a href="../../implementation-strategy-tools-collaboration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented DevOps</a> culture for the past few years. 50 percent of organizations have already implemented SRE for automation and enhanced reliability.</p>
<p>SRE and DevOps have standard features because both approaches monitor production and ensure operation management runs smoothly. They both aim to improve the performance of complicated distributed systems. They both trust that change is mandatory to improve and emphasize the importance of people working as a team with shared responsibilities. They focus on enabling reliability and automation.</p>
<p>DevOps and SRE can coexist since the two methodologies aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive. The work culture is different in both models, and they both share some foundational values. But in this world of numerous options, zeroing in on an MSP is an arduous task. This is where <strong>Veritis</strong> steps in, a <a href="../../veritis-clinches-the-prestigious-stevie-award-for-its-devops-excellence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stevie Award winner</a> that offers numerous technology services and cutting-edge tools for competitive differentiation.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13965 size-full" title="What’s SaaS, and What are the SaaS Tools You Should Use?" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/whats-saas-and-what-are-the-saas-tools-you-should-use.jpg" alt="What’s SaaS, and What are the SaaS Tools You Should Use?" width="800" height="422" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/whats-saas-and-what-are-the-saas-tools-you-should-use.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/whats-saas-and-what-are-the-saas-tools-you-should-use-300x158.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/whats-saas-and-what-are-the-saas-tools-you-should-use-768x405.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>SaaS is something you may hear of from time to time. But, what exactly is that? <strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> is an approach where you don’t have to buy software and possess it permanently. Instead, whatever software packages you need will be provided to you on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
<p>So, instead of saddling yourself with the software even when you don’t need it, SaaS allows you to rent the software for the required duration. The offering also wicks away licensing issues and compliance issues as they are taken care of by the <a href="../../www_veritis_default_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaaS provider</a> or the MSP that you have roped in.</p>
<p>While it may give you the impression that these software packages, which you would seek once in a blue moon, SaaS is something that most companies regularly use across the world, the SaaS usage not only provides you software that is ready to be used but also gives you control over your hardware as you get to configure the hardware which would support the software.</p>
<p>In addition, these SaaS models add value to your business with their simplistic subscription model. So, in this blog, we shall explore why should go for <strong>SaaS tools</strong> are and what tools are preferred for what services.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Using SaaS Tools</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13957 size-full" title="Advantages of Using SaaS Tools" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/advantages-of-using-saas-tools.jpg" alt="Advantages of Using SaaS Tools" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/advantages-of-using-saas-tools.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/advantages-of-using-saas-tools-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/advantages-of-using-saas-tools-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Gone are the days when you would have to bargain and cough hefty prices on software packages that would later become redundant. Instead, this saves you time by allowing you to use the latest solutions installed and maintained by the MSP.</p>
<p>The software you would rope in would allow you to share it with numerous clients, and you would not have to configure the software every time you share with these <strong>SaaS tools</strong>. This option saves you time and money. And, given the easy management of the tools, the tools are easily scalable, which facilitates you to further your business goals better than before.</p>
<p>Today, we have plenty of SaaS tools for any and almost every task. This is both a welcome and unwelcome development as the former gives you a choice to use whichever tool you want, but the extreme variety of tools would confuse you. The latter shall only set you back by eating away your time, and should you choose wrong, you will be incurring unwanted expenses. So, to avoid that, let’s have a look at the tools.</p>

<h3>What makes these tools ‘Best’?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13963 size-full" title="What Makes These Tools ‘Best’?" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-makes-these-tools-best.jpg" alt="What Makes These Tools ‘Best’?" width="800" height="404" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-makes-these-tools-‘best.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-makes-these-tools-‘best-300x152.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-makes-these-tools-‘best-768x388.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>In the current day, speed and reliability are key aspects that make them good. But, the ‘best’ should allow innovation through collaboration and have the capacity to shoulder various essential tasks. Whether project management or large-scale mails, the tools should not flinch when subjected to a large amount of pressure, and they don’t buckle, which sets them apart from the standard tools.</p>
<p><em>So, let’s dig into the best tools for the most used services.</em></p>

<h3>Trello: Project Management Tool</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13962 size-full" title="Trello: Project Management Tool" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/trello-project-management-tool.jpg" alt="Trello: Project Management Tool" width="800" height="158" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/trello-project-management-tool.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/trello-project-management-tool-300x59.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/trello-project-management-tool-768x152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Project management is one of the most crucial aspects of a product. From deciding the rollout of the update to how the product lifecycle should be implemented, a lot of action occurs in project management. Realizing its potential, Trello forayed and made its mark as a SaaS project management tool.</p>
<p><strong>Trello</strong>, a popular tool, uses the Kanban method to better and ease the interactions between the project members and vital people. The tool comes along with a board that allows the project members to visualize the roadmap. In other words, every board is divvied into columns, and every column has different processes listed in them. These columns will help the members list and understand what’s done and remain to be completed.</p>
<h3>Zoom: Video Conferencing Tool</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13967 size-full" title="Zoom: Video Conferencing Tool" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoom-video-conferencing-tool.jpg" alt="Zoom: Video Conferencing Tool" width="800" height="158" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoom-video-conferencing-tool.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoom-video-conferencing-tool-300x59.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoom-video-conferencing-tool-768x152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>COVID-19 popularized <strong>Zoom</strong>, the video conferencing utility you and kids used immensely. The primary advantage was its low latency network and the feature that a great deal could be done with paying a buck. While a paid version of it exists, most users didn’t see the need for it as a lot can be achieved with short-duration calls. However, it is wise to go for the paid version if you see the need for the paid version.</p>
<p>The tool comes with various features which foster collaboration, and it is pretty easy to be used. From screen sharing to participant control, Zoom is one of the most popular collaboration tools, and it works on any platform.</p>
<p>There are other variants, such as MS Teams and Google Meet tools which you can rely upon should you decide not to use Zoom for reasons best known to you.</p>
<h3>Slack: Communication Tool</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13960 size-full" title="Slack: Communication Tool" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/slack-communication-tool.jpg" alt="Slack: Communication Tool" width="800" height="158" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/slack-communication-tool.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/slack-communication-tool-300x59.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/slack-communication-tool-768x152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>First off, Slack’s notification sound is rather addictive. However, <strong>Slack</strong> packs more than a notification sounds as it is one of the most preferred communication tools. Its UI makes the chatting and sharing easy, features favored by companies where documents are regularly transferred among themselves and external parties. In addition, one can engage in both video and audio calls which boost collaboration. Be it group creation or its numerous integration; Slack can be your preferred communications tool as it allows you to connect beyond Slack as users can use MS Teams through Slack Connect.</p>

<h3>Mailchimp: Mailing Tool</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13958 size-full" title="Mailchimp: Mailing Tool" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mailchimp-mailing-tool.jpg" alt="Mailchimp: Mailing Tool" width="800" height="158" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mailchimp-mailing-tool.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mailchimp-mailing-tool-300x59.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mailchimp-mailing-tool-768x152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><strong>Mailchimp</strong> is software that allows you to mail to a large set of mail recipients. In addition, the online marketing tool allows you to automate mail deliveries and manage ad campaigns. The tool is compatible with multiple platforms, and various users ranging from freelancers to massive organizations prefer Mailchimp as their mailing tool.</p>
<h3>Zendesk: Help Desk Software</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13966 size-full" title="Zendesk: Help Desk Software" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zendesk-help-desk-software.jpg" alt="Zendesk: Help Desk Software" width="800" height="158" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zendesk-help-desk-software.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zendesk-help-desk-software-300x59.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zendesk-help-desk-software-768x152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><strong>Zendesk</strong> is the bridge between the company and its customers. While it is used by most companies as to help desk software, Zendesk can also be used for business leads. In plain language, Zendesk is a tool that aims to simplify the client support aspect. It possesses enough capabilities to blend data and engagements from various platforms. One of the offerings from Zendesk is the Sunshine CRM platform which lends a holistic view of the data. However, you should know that there is no free version of the available tool.</p>
<h3>Top Document Management Tool: Google Drive</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13970 size-full" title="Google Drive" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-drive.jpg" alt="Google Drive" width="800" height="158" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-drive.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-drive-300x59.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-drive-768x152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>This is a tool that probably doesn’t even need an introduction as most, if not all, have used <strong>Google drive</strong> at some point. From regular documents to video files to storage of files in any format, one can create a shareable link for viewing and downloading purposes. The drive’s advantage is that one can configure the permissions, which can share from the essential viewing permission and lend the user the permission to download and edit the files.</p>
<p>Additionally, the fast upload and download speeds are pretty reliable. The users get 15 GB of storage, which is quite a lot if you are only indulging in document sharing, but if your files are of massive sizes, you will likely exhaust the 15 GB in no time, and you would have to go to the paid version. Finally, the drive can be used from any OS and requires a browser alone is enough to upload the files.</p>
<h3>Salesforce Sales Cloud: Customer Relationship Management tool</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13959 size-full" title="Salesforce Sales Cloud: Customer Relationship Management tool" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/salesforce-sales-cloud-customer-relationship-management-tool.jpg" alt="Salesforce Sales Cloud: Customer Relationship Management tool" width="800" height="158" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/salesforce-sales-cloud-customer-relationship-management-tool.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/salesforce-sales-cloud-customer-relationship-management-tool-300x59.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/salesforce-sales-cloud-customer-relationship-management-tool-768x152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>DevOps for CRM speeds the agile cycle and assures productivity while developing CRM modules. <strong>Salesforce Service Cloud</strong>, commonly known as Salesforce Ticketing System, is a flexible CRM that gives customers a 360-degree picture of their business. The capacity to serve huge enterprises and the Salesforce CRM, which contains many configurable features and cases instead of tickets, are two of the tool&#8217;s advantages. However, CRM is rather complicated for novice users, and this solution is not suitable for businesses looking for free solutions.</p>

<h3>Tableau: Analytics tools</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13961 size-full" title="Tableau: Analytics tools" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/tableau-analytics-tools.jpg" alt="Tableau: Analytics tools" width="800" height="158" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/tableau-analytics-tools.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/tableau-analytics-tools-300x59.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/tableau-analytics-tools-768x152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>By monitoring performance, marketing analytics tools help firms to oversee, analyze, and govern their marketing operations. As a renowned leader in analytics, <strong>Tableau</strong> supports people and organizations in becoming more data-driven by demonstrating the ROI of produced software. It works on various platforms and includes complex and basic visualizations like histograms and Gantt charts. Tableau is also a prominent participant as a BI tool because of its drag-and-drop feature.</p>
<p>Another tool worth mentioning is <strong>Semrush</strong>, a popular SaaS tool for managing internet reputation. The most significant benefit of this application is its efficient platform, which allows you to follow competition information. However, this has the drawback of requiring 100 percent exact search filters for the tool to deliver correct results.</p>

<h4>Capping it off</h4>

In addition, various tools are there in the same service. For instance, Zendesk also provides similar tools such as Salesforce Sales Cloud. While that choice eases things greatly, it also consumes a great deal of time, and a poor choice will saddle you with burgeoning bills. These are some of the reasons why one opts for an MSP.</p>

<p>The advent of automation and cloud technology has become more efficient, simpler, and more reliable in providing complex infrastructure. For Instance, APIs can automate the resources in <a href="../lack-cloud-expertise-cost-enterprises-250-million-annually/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud platforms</a> such as <a href="../../aws-vs-azure-vs-gcp-the-cloud-platform-of-your-choice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>. Moreover, your application&#8217;s underlying architecture and configuration may now automate by using code.</p>
<p><a href="../../cloud-infrastructure-automation-the-imperative-for-cloud-success.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</a> permits users to define, deploy, update, and delete infrastructure by writing and executing the code. This approach treats all operations as software even though that represents the hardware configuration. As a result, organizations can reduce the risk of configuration drift and achieve more dependable outcomes in their architectures if they run IaC tools to develop their application environments.</p>
<p>Terraform is the first service tool that springs to mind regarding infrastructure provisioning, including the AWS EKS Cluster. Terraform is considerably easier to learn than manually putting up infrastructure. Terraform is one of the most popular IaC tools and an open-source, cloud-agnostic provisioning tool platform used to change, build and version infrastructure securely and efficiently. It&#8217;s convenient for setting up sophisticated platforms like Kubernetes clusters, which have become more popular as cloud-native solutions gain traction.</p>
<p>To reduce the complexity of cluster management, <a href="../lack-cloud-expertise-cost-enterprises-250-million-annually/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud service providers</a> such as AWS have established managed services like Amazon EKS (Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes). AWS is wholly responsible for running, managing, provisioning, and auto-scaling the nodes. It is the master across a wide range of AWS Availability Zones (AZs) and ensures high availability. Unless they adopt the Fargate serverless engine, users are entirely responsible for managing and adding the EC2 worker nodes.</p>
<p>Before going in-depth info about how to deploy a Kubernetes application with AWS EKS and terraform, let&#8217;s explore the concepts first &#8211; what is Terraform, the advantages of Terraform, how does terraform work, and what is AWS EKS.</p>

<h2>What is Terraform?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13948 size-full" title="What is Terraform?" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-terraform.jpg" alt="What is Terraform?" width="800" height="463" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-terraform.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-terraform-300x174.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-terraform-768x444.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Terraform is an open-source &#8216;Infrastructure as code&#8217; software application that allows users to create, alter and improve infrastructure safely and reasonably. Users can use a consistent workflow to provide and manage the infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage both low-level and high-level components, such as compute, storage, and networking resources for low-level and DNS records as well as SaaS services for high levels.</p>
<p>Terraform for infrastructure as a code software platform employs declarative configure files to codify cloud APIs and permit users to manage hundreds of cloud services using a standard CLI approach. The Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service responsible for scaling, deploying, and managing the containerized applications with Kubernetes in the cloud or on-premises.</p>
<p>Terraform is an IaC tool that defines both on-premises and cloud resources in human-readable configuration files that users can reuse and share. In addition, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approaches use multiple ways to manage modern infrastructures with tools such as AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), Hashicorp&#8217;s Terraform, and AWS CloudFormation.</p>
<h3>How does Terraform work?</h3>
<p>Terraform operates application programming interfaces to create and manage resources on the cloud platform and other services (APIs). Thanks to providers who allow Terraform to work, this application can work with almost any platform or service that has an accessible API.</p>
<p>HashiCorp and the Terraform community have built more than 1700 providers to handle thousands of various types of resources and services, and the number continues to increase. The Terraform Registry lists all available service providers, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), DataDog, GitHub, <a href="../../kubernetes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a>, Helm, Splunk, and many more to the list.</p>
<p><strong>There are three stages for the Terraform workflow:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Write:</strong> Users create resources that come across numerous cloud services and providers. For instance, in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network with security groups and a load balancer, you might develop a configuration to deploy an application on virtual machines.</p>
<p><strong>2) Plan:</strong> Terraform generates an execution plan that defines the infrastructure, and it will create, update, or delete depending on your configuration&#8217;s existing infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>3) Apply:</strong> Terraform executes the proposed activities in the correct order, considering any resource dependencies. For instance, if you modify the number of virtual machines in a VPC and update its characteristics. Terraform will rediscover the VPC before reducing the virtual machines.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Terraform</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13942 size-full" title="Benefits of Terraform" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-terraform.png" alt="Benefits of Terraform" width="800" height="459" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-terraform.png 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-terraform-300x172.png 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits-of-terraform-768x441.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Terraform can manage custom in-house solutions as well as popular and existing service providers. Operating Terraform to provision the infrastructure has numerous advantages for EKS clusters, including other resources managed through IaC.</p>
<h4>A) Efficiency and reliability</h4>
<p>An automated deployment technique allows significantly faster infrastructure changes. Terraform executes the intended state by running underlying API requests in the correct order, with the flexibility to specify resource prerequisite requirements.</p>
<h4>B) Automated deployments</h4>
<p>You can run CI/CD approaches to automating the provisioning of your infrastructure if your infrastructure is defined as code. Manual deployments by individual personnel are no longer required with <a href="../../ci-cd-services-integrate-and-automate-devops.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI/CD pipelines</a>. Instead, more people can be empowered to activate pipelines without requiring a technical understanding of manual processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, your infrastructure as code can have rich quality checks like automated testing in the CI stage of the pipeline as well as pull requests for changes to the source code.</p>
<h4>C) Infrastructure as code</h4>
<p>Infrastructure as code, rather as physical hardware setup or interactive configuration tools, controls, and provision computer data centres through machine-readable specification files. Terraform permits users to run operating coding techniques to construct, change, and version their infrastructure. It will allow you to design your infrastructure or apps using configuration files, as well as store the status of the user&#8217;s infrastructure for later updates or modifications.</p>
<h4>D) Execution plans</h4>
<p>The Terraform plan command executes a set of execution instructions. By default, creating a project involves reading any existing remote objects&#8217; present state to ensure that the Terraform state is currently up to date. In addition, it notes the differences between the current configuration and the initial state.</p>
<p>Terraform features a stage called planning that develops an execution plan. Then, when you apply for a call, the execution plan displays how Terraform will perform. This allows you to avoid any Terraform surprises.</p>
<h4>E) Reduced development prices</h4>
<p>Creating deployment environments and on-demand development can help you save money. Moreover, you can evaluate such situations prior to updating system changes.</p>
<h4>F) Reduced time to provision</h4>
<p>A company&#8217;s traditional click-ops deployment processes can take days or even weeks, prone to errors. Full deployment with Terraform can take as little as a few minutes. For instance, you can standardize provision of numerous Alibaba Cloud services at once. Migrations, as well as new deployments can be completed efficiently and rapidly.</p>

<h3>Terraform with Kubernetes</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13946 size-full" title="Terraform with Kubernetes" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/terraform-with-kubernetes.jpg" alt="Terraform with Kubernetes" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/terraform-with-kubernetes.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/terraform-with-kubernetes-300x188.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/terraform-with-kubernetes-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The concepts of Terraform and Kubernetes are pretty perplexed. But actually, they both work together for output, and they are not alternatives.</p>
<p>Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an extensible, portable, open-source container orchestration platform built to automate containerized applications&#8217; scaling, management, and deployment. Indeed, Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration. It is the flagship project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), backed by top MNCs such as Microsoft, IBM, Google, AWS, Intel, Red Hat, and Cisco.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Terraform is a massive infrastructure as a code solution that permits developers to automate the whole infrastructure across many public and private clouds. This application automates and manages the Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or even Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) level abilities. All of these resources are in parallel across all of those service providers. Terraform can automate the provisioning of Kubernetes clusters, especially the deployment of applications into a cluster and managed Kubernetes clusters on the cloud platforms.</p>
<h3>Deploying Kubernetes Applications with Terraform</h3>
<p>Design the pattern for the Kubernetes provider by creating a namespace, then deploying the application in a pod, and revealing the pod to users as a service at the end, which is the ideal way to work with or interact with Terraform Kubernetes provider.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, you&#8217;ll need to have your Kubernetes cluster up and operating to do all of this. The four steps are outlined below:</strong></p>
<p>1) Setup our Kubernetes service provider</p>
<p>2) Pod Deployment</p>
<p>3) Display the Pod with a service</p>
<p>4) Finally, verify the app is running</p>

<h3>What is Amazon EKS?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13947 size-full" title="What is Amazon EKS?" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-amazon-eks.jpg" alt="What is Amazon EKS?" width="800" height="408" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-amazon-eks.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-amazon-eks-300x153.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-amazon-eks-768x392.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (AWS EKS) is a service platform that manages and provisions the control panel of your Kubernetes applications in the on-premises or cloud. This means you don&#8217;t need to worry about the upgrades, high availability, and the security of your control panel.</p>
<p>It operates your Kubernetes management infrastructure across numerous AWS Availability Zones to get rid of a single point of failure. AWS EKS is Kubernetes-compliant; users may allow running existing Kubernetes plugins and tools from the community and partner. The application that runs on any regular Kubernetes environment is entirely compatible with AWS EKS and can be migrated.</p>
<h3>AWS ECR</h3>
<p>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is an AWS product that manages, stores, and deploys Docker container registry service. Users&#8217; container images are stored in a highly available and scalable architecture on an Amazon ECR private registry. ECR supports public and private repositories, which are more secure. By running AWS CLI, users can either pull or push pics to ECR.</p>
<h3>Deploying a Kubernetes Applications using AWS EKS</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13943 size-full" title="Deploying a Kubernetes Applications using AWS EKS" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/deploying-a-kubernetes-applications-using-aws-eks.jpg" alt="Deploying a Kubernetes Applications using AWS EKS" width="800" height="462" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/deploying-a-kubernetes-applications-using-aws-eks.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/deploying-a-kubernetes-applications-using-aws-eks-300x173.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/deploying-a-kubernetes-applications-using-aws-eks-768x444.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>By using Node.js, you have to create a simple web application</li>
<li>Develop a web application Docker image</li>
<li>When we push the Docker image, AWS ECR will receive it</li>
<li>For the EKS cluster, develop a VPC by using public and private subnets</li>
<li>Develop a Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>Develop Kubernetes workers like private and public workers</li>
<li>Using Kubernetes, deploy your web application</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Users should have an active AWS account with a subscription and allow to access your AWS IAM account with credentials. Create an AWS account and an IAM user in your AWS account if you don&#8217;t already have one.</p>
<p>The most recent version of the AWS command-line interface (CLI) should be installed at a location in your system path.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), a managed Kubernetes cluster, reduce the complexity and overhead of provision and optimize the control planes for software teams. Moreover, automation technology such as IaC improves the infrastructure management life cycle with numerous advantages. However, if there are no tools to allow pertinent insight, reporting, and monitoring for optimal usage, Kubernetes cluster management in AWS might have substantial economic implications.</p>
<p>Terraform is a significant IaC tool that permits users to create, version control, and modify the cloud and on-premises resources efficiently and securely. Terraform Kubernetes deployment can eliminate human errors and save time when running a traditional model for application deployment. Users can run the Terraform Kubernetes Deployment method to develop an EKS cluster with Terraform while automating the EKS cluster with the creation process and having additional control over the complete infrastructure management process via code.</p>
<p>Deploying a Kubernetes application with AWS EKS and Terraform is a complicated task. This is why companies seek Veritis&#8217;s services.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13915 size-full" title="How to Optimize Kubernetes Autoscaler to Better Business" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/how-to-optimize-kubernetes-autoscaler-to-better-business.jpg" alt="How to Optimize Kubernetes Autoscaler to Better Business" width="800" height="422" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/how-to-optimize-kubernetes-autoscaler-to-better-business.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/how-to-optimize-kubernetes-autoscaler-to-better-business-300x158.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/how-to-optimize-kubernetes-autoscaler-to-better-business-768x405.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Kubernetes, the open-source tool, is one of the most popular containers. Initially conceptualized and owned by Google, Kubernetes was made available for free. While other containers such as docker and vagrant are widely used, Kubernetes has garnered enough traction to be in its league. This is primarily due to how easy, and cost-effective Kubernetes or Kubes is.</p>
<p>While Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is popular among developers, not every developer is aware of the true potential of the container. So, while Kubernetes is used for its easy development and deployment process, Kubernetes is also in demand for its Autoscaling feature.</p>
<p>Kubernetes Autoscaling is a key feature that allows seamless scaling with multiple mechanisms. While the cloud has made scaling synonymous with cakewalk, there is much more to the scaling than one assumes, and Kubernetes made the scaling process better than most.</p>
<p>As alluded to, Kubernetes has different scaling methods, which we shall explore in this blog. For the curious soul, the three methods of Kubernetes autoscaling are Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, Vertical Pod Autoscaler, and Cluster Autoscaler. We shall look into these processes and how they help the automation of application scaling.</p>
<h3>Understanding Kubernetes Autoscaling</h3>
<p>Automation is an aspect that companies are still finding their way about. The shrewdest ones embrace Kubernetes as one can automate processes with Kubes, ranging from provisioning to scaling. This automation saves time and money and wicks away manual intervention as automated scaling or autoscaling handles all these issues, ranging from demand spikes to scaling down resources. This method can be used along with Cluster Autoscaler, which, like Kubernetes autoscaling, uses the required resources without intervention.</p>
<p>While ‘autoscaling’ bears the semblance of a ‘good-to-have feature,’ it is a must-have should you keep experiencing spikes and have a lot of error-prone tasks. You dedicate resources and time to make the required changes in manual scaling.</p>
<p>But, with autoscaling, you would not have to intervene as resources are either roped in or shed as and when required. With this dynamic and responsive scaling, Kubernetes Autoscaling saves your money and improves your quality. While it sounds like there is one autoscaling, there are three different autoscaling methods in Kubes.</p>
<p><em>Let’s look at them!</em></p>
<h3>Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13916 size-full" title="Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-horizontal-pod-autoscaler.jpg" alt="Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler" width="800" height="438" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-horizontal-pod-autoscaler.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-horizontal-pod-autoscaler-300x164.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-horizontal-pod-autoscaler-768x420.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The ‘Horizontal’ in Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler would appear familiar to the people familiar with horizontal scaling. The Kubes Horizontal Austoscaler modifies the number of pods to meet the growing demand. It effectively modifies the workload aspects, which may range from deployment to StatefulSet, and thereby it ensures that the company meets the demand it is required to.</p>
<p>The Kubes Horizontal Pod also has the diligence to shed the resources when the demand dips. This process allows the software applications to scale up or down without manual intervention. The scale-down may not appear important, but when a software application scales down, it frees up the nodes which are no longer fully utilized. Other resources will be saved by shedding the unwanted nodes, and you will be laden with a cost-effective <a href="../../kubernetes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes solution</a>.</p>
<p>Also, Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling doesn’t gel with unscalable loads. This includes DaemonSets, which perform on the “one pod per node” principle. These unscalable loads remove the chance of replicas and thereby remove the possibility of executing horizontal pod autoscaling.</p>

<h3>Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13917 size-full" title="Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-vertical-pod-autoscaler.jpg" alt="Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler" width="800" height="440" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-vertical-pod-autoscaler.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-vertical-pod-autoscaler-300x165.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-vertical-pod-autoscaler-768x422.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Kubes Vertical Pod Autoscaler or VPA is a tool that allows you to boost up the existing pods in terms of processing and memory. This method can be embraced with one required to rope in more processing power to get the task done, and the VPA scales up the concerned values and makes it up-to-date. This scaling-up includes memory and CPU power and keeps a check on the number of containers in the pods. As Kubernetes VPA scales up the power of the required pods, it also frees up CPU and memory resources in other pods.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of VPA is that your pods will become quite efficient as they will use only the required number of nodes. You would also save time as VPA would take care of the mundane benchmarking procedures, typically about identifying the optimal CPU capacity and other aspects. With all these aspects taken care of, your maintenance time shall dip as VPA maintains everything automatically.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaling</h2>
<p>The Kubernetes Autoscaler adds or removes nodes to raise or reduce the size of a Kubernetes cluster based on the availability of pending pods and node utilization metrics.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes Autoscaler adds nodes to the cluster when it detects waiting for pods that can&#8217;t be scheduled, possibly causing resource restrictions. Furthermore, when a node&#8217;s usage falls below a certain threshold established by the cluster administrator, the node is removed from the cluster, enabling all pods to function and removing unneeded nodes.</p>
<h4>Delving Deeper into Nodes</h4>
<p>EKS is in charge of <a href="../../kubernetes-as-a-service-for-container-infrastructure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes-as-a-Service</a>. This, however, largely applies to the Kubernetes control plane. For the pods to be deployed, you must still contribute compute nodes to your EKS Cluster. You may build worker nodes for your EKS Cluster in two methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Managed Nodes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may establish, maintain, and administer your worker nodes using this tool, giving you more authority over your platforms.</p>
<ul>

<h3>Understanding Blue-Green Deployment and Rolling Updates in Kubes</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13919 size-full" title="Understanding Blue-Green Deployment and Rolling Updates in Kubes" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/understanding-blue-green-deployment-and-rolling-updates-in-kubes.jpg" alt="Understanding Blue-Green Deployment and Rolling Updates in Kubes" width="800" height="548" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/understanding-blue-green-deployment-and-rolling-updates-in-kubes.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/understanding-blue-green-deployment-and-rolling-updates-in-kubes-300x206.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/understanding-blue-green-deployment-and-rolling-updates-in-kubes-768x526.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Amongst the most crucial things to understand is how to safely roll out the new version of the program while the previous one is still running. Can the existing pods be replaced without causing traffic congestion? That is one of the biggest questions one would have while dealing with Kubes and its autoscaling feature.</p>
<p>Kubernetes can be deployed in different ways. We&#8217;ve provided two choices below that allow for secure deployment while keeping the possibility to go back in time if needed.</p>
<h4>Blue-Green</h4>
<p>Blue-green deployment is a method that involves running two identical production environments, Blue and Green, to minimize outages and risks. Either of the environments is active at any given moment, with the active instance providing all operational data. Blue is currently active, while Green is inactive in this case.</p>
<p>Deployment and the final round of testing for a new version of your program occur in a non-live environment, such as Green in this case. You change the router so that all incoming queries flow to Green instead of Blue once you&#8217;ve deployed and completely tested the software in Green. Green is now active, whereas Blue is dormant.</p>
<h4>Rolling Update</h4>
<p>One of the key benefits of utilizing a Deployment to regulate your pods is the ability to execute rolling updates. Deployments provide you with complete control over the process while rolling updates let you gradually alter the configuration of your pods. When configuring rolling updates, update planning is the main aspect.</p>
<p>In the Deployment declaration, your strategy will have two possible values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling Update: New pods are gradually introduced, while old pods get slowly phased out in this rolling update.</li>
<li>Recreate: The old pods are ended well before fresh pods get placed.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Kubernetes autoscaling is great, it is always good to explore other options as it would help you use another tool should one give away.</p>
<h4>Karpenter</h4>
<p>Karpenter is a Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler built on AWS that is open-source, configurable, and high-performing. It boosts application availability and cluster efficiency by rapidly deploying the right computing resources in response to changing application loads.</p>
<p>Karpenter also provides ad hoc computing resources to meet your application&#8217;s needs, and it will soon provide a cluster compute resource footprint, which will reduce costs while improving performance. In addition, Karpenter analyses the overall resource requirements of unplanned pods and chooses whether to deploy new nodes or terminate current ones to decrease planning delays and capital costs.</p>

<h3>Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13918 size-full" title="Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-based-event-driven-autoscaling-keda.jpg" alt="Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)" width="800" height="402" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-based-event-driven-autoscaling-keda.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-based-event-driven-autoscaling-keda-300x151.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kubernetes-based-event-driven-autoscaling-keda-768x386.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Microsoft and Red Hat built KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event-driven Autoscaling), an open-source component that allows Kubernetes workloads to gain from an event-driven architecture approach.</p>
<p>A Kubernetes Deployment or Job may be horizontally scaled with KEDA. It is built on the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. It allows users to provide autoscaling criteria based on data from any event source, such as Kafka topic lag with Prometheus query parameters. When autoscaling a Deployment or a Job, you may choose from a list of pre-defined triggers that serve as a source of events and statistics.</p>

<h4>Capping it off</h4>
<p>As we end the blog here, we believe you have walked away with more than a general idea of how Kubernetes Autoscaling would assist you in scaling resources in and out of your Kubernetes Cluster. Also, keep in mind that the Kubernetes Autoscaling layers (nodes/pods) are vital and interconnected.</p>
<p>HPA may be used to scale the number of pods coming in and out. For instance, raise the pod count as consumption rises and decrease the pod count as user load falls. To assist you in &#8220;right-size&#8221; your applications, HPA raises or lowers the pod count, whereas VPA automatically increases or decreases the CPU and memory reservations of the pods.</p>
<p>HPA and VPA accomplish pod-level Kubernetes autoscaling. To expand the number of nodes in the cluster, you&#8217;ll require the Kubernetes Autoscaler. This ultimately brings Kubes back into the picture.</p>
<p>While Kubernetes autoscaling sounds easy, using the containers isn’t as easy as one would assume. The experienced people who have dealt with it realized that the Kubes know there is more to the containers than meets the eye.

<p>Technologies have become more integrated into our day-to-day operations, and organizations are heavily relying on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to stay up with the pace of consumer demands. You can witness its application in social media via object recognition in photographs or directly communicating with the devices like Siri or Alexa.</p>
<p>Machine learning and deep learning concepts have seen ground-breaking developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) during the last decade, reshaping the world around us. Businesses are enthralled by the potential opportunities to invest in these emerging technologies, from AI to blockchain. However, both DL and ML are artificial intelligence terms, and their definitions may appear to be interchangeable to newcomers.</p>
<p>Recently, deep learning and machine learning have seen a golden era as these applications have become ubiquitous. In addition, these technologies have become increasingly personalized in our interactions with them. For instance, chatbots can be annoying and still pretty clumsy in their current state, but they are evolving. They have become conversational, learning human characteristics, increasing user experience, and supplementing your customer service approach.</p>
<p>According to the Comet survey, the cloud-based meta machine learning platform, 508 ML practitioners stated that 58 percent respondents are using manual tools to track ML experiments while 47 percent of respondents said that ML teams require 6 months to deploy a single ML project. Moreover, 88 percent of respondents have a budget of less than USD 75,000 for ML tools and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Echoing similar sentiments for deep learning are other surveys. Grand View Research predicted that global deep learning industry market size is estimated to grow USD 526.7 billion at a CGAR of 34.3% over the forecast period by 2030. This technology was projected at USD 34.8 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>Based on the business requirements, your organization can decide which one to implement. Before diving into the crux of the topic, let’s explore the concepts first.</p>

<h3>Deep Learning (DL)</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13904 size-full" title="Deep Learning" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/05/deep-learning.jpg" alt="Deep Learning" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/deep-learning.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/deep-learning-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/deep-learning-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The term deep learning was coined 79 years ago – in 1943, mathematician Walter Pitts and neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch worked together to create a computer-based model. They began to translate neural networks onto computational systems of the human brain.</p>
<p>Deep learning is a subset of the machine learning family, and it comes under the category of artificial intelligence. This technology is a powerful tool that uses three or more layers of neural network algorithms to perform sophisticated computations on a massive amount of data. It is the most crucial element of data science, including predictive modeling and statistics. DL makes the process easier and faster for data scientists and researchers, who interpret, analyze, and collect a considerable volume of data.</p>
<p>DL model has attracted a lot of attention because it drives many <strong>AI services</strong> and applications, such as high computing power, improved automation, advancements in data center capabilities, and performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. In addition, deep learning algorithms perform routine and repetitive tasks more effectively and quickly than human beings.</p>
<p>Deep learning can be beneficial for real-world applications such as voice-enabled TV remotes, digital assistants, credit card fraud detections and emerging technology such as self-driving cars.</p>
<p>In deep learning, models operate different layers to discover and learn insights from the data. Some best deep learning models are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recurrent Neural Network</li>
<li>Convolutional Neural Network</li>
<li>Autoencoders</li>
<li>Classic Neural Networks and more</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Does Deep Learning Work?</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the algorithm’s working principle before moving to the deep learning model. For instance, we all know about neurons in the brain (cells) that capture inputs coming through sensory organs like ears, eyes, etc. When a neuron receives an input signal, it passes the signal through the body and gets activated to produce output. This output will stimulate other neurons to activate so that we can get the complete picture.</p>
<p>Understanding the working of deep learning with the above instance, the deep learning model takes the images as input and feeds them directly to the algorithms without having any manual feature extraction step. The input passes to multiple layers of the AI neural network to estimate the final output.</p>
<h3>Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13905 size-full" title="Machine Learning" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/05/machine-learning.jpg" alt="Machine Learning" width="800" height="438" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/machine-learning.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/machine-learning-300x164.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/machine-learning-768x420.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Arthur Samuel coined the term machine learning in 1959 and pioneer of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and computer gaming. Over the few years, the top MNC companies have invested significantly in this technology and left no stone unturned to stay high on top of today’s IT world.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a branch of the artificial family that enables systems to adapt to new data independently and through iterations. It is a process of data analytics that automatically access data and perform tasks through detections and predictions. ML focuses on developing computer programs that can learn data, make decisions, and identify patterns, which involves minimal human intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning</strong> is a member of the artificial intelligence family that aims to create software that can automatically learn from past data to gain knowledge and gradually improve its learning behavior to make the right predictions depending on the new data.</p>
<p>ML is one of the most pivotal and commanding technologies that one would have ever come across. Yet, despite the scope of improvement and investment, developing, maintaining, and training MI models has been ad-hoc and cumbersome. However, transforming machine languages into assistive technology devices is complicated enough to make AI seek help from ML to machines understand as humans do.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a crucial concept for any aspiring data scientist and data analyst and those who wish to transform a bulk amount of raw data into predictions. Both deep learning and machine learning fall under the category of artificial intelligence, and both these models learn from data input.</p>
<h3>How Does Machine Learning Work?</h3>
<p>Machine learning primarily involves two different approaches, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.</p>

<h4>Supervised Learning</h4>
<p>Supervised learning is an algorithm that learns from labeled training data to help machines predict the output. It deals with the unlabelled data. It is a subcategory of <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>.</p>
<h4>Unsupervised Learning</h4>
<p>Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to cluster and analyze hidden patterns in input data without regard to output. It allows users to perform more complicated tasks compared to supervised learning. Unsupervised learning algorithms include neural networks, clustering, anomaly detection, and more.</p>

<h4>Conclusion on Deep Learning and Machine Learning</h4>
<p>Understanding the latest advances in <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> might be daunting. Still, if you only want to master the basics, many AI discoveries can be boiled down to two concepts: deep learning and machine learning. There are numerous examples of deep learning and machine learning, and we can witness them everywhere.</p>
<p>How self-driving cars become a reality, how Netflix predicts which show you&#8217;ll like to watch next, and how Facebook detects who is in a photograph. These models seem to be interchangeable buzzwords in the artificial intelligence industry, but they have some key differences.</p>
<p>As a result, deep learning is the way to opt for your business if you have enormous data and powerful technology. Otherwise, implement a machine learning model for your business.  As you can witness numerous benefits while opting for both these models, picking the best technology is an arduous task that makes it challenging to pick.</p>

<p><a href="../../containerization-services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containerization</a> has reinvented the working style as they are easier to deploy and manage. Docker further popularized them to an extent where it has become synonymous with the container. While all the dockers are containers, vice-versa is not valid. But what is the buzz surrounding Docker, and what are the other alternatives one can go for if Docker isn’t their first choice.</p>
<h3>Overview of Docker</h3>
<p>Like its sibling Kubernetes, Docker is an open-source <a href="../devops-made-easier-with-devops-tools/made-easier-with-devops-tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps tool</a> favored highly among IT people. It was initially compatible with Linux alone, but now Docker is highly compatible with Windows and macOS. The <a href="../../services/docker/docker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker technology</a> allows developers to create applications with OS, run-time tools, and other dependencies. Despite being packed to the hilt with features, the dockers are easy to maintain, and they can be deployed automatically on the chosen infrastructure.</p>
<p>Cloud-native approach and <a href="../../multi-cloud-strategy-emerging-as-the-new-cloud-reality-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-cloud strategies</a> have only propelled the usage of Docker as they ease the operations, which span from building to maintenance as Docker allows management through API and other command interfaces in various environments.</p>
<p>The open-source tool possesses an edge over the virtual machines as the former encapsulates the virtual resources in the OS kernel. At the same time, the latter is backward by encapsulating the entire OS. It also lets you execute numerous containers in the same infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Understanding Docker</h3>
<p><strong>Docker’s</strong> capabilities are centered on Docker Engine. This is one of the most crucial components of the Docker application as it installs a server-side daemon, a repository that houses containers and other crucial data. The Docker also creates a client-side CLI, which facilitates server communications through APIs’. Developers refer to Docker containers as Dockerfiles.</p>

<h2>Why is Docker Preferred</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13887 size-full" title="Why is Docker Preferred?" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/05/why-is-docker-preferred.jpg" alt="Why is Docker Preferred?" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/why-is-docker-preferred.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/why-is-docker-preferred-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/why-is-docker-preferred-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Docker is preferred for various reasons. However, as the blog is about <strong>Docker</strong>, we shall highlight only Docker&#8217;s biggest benefits.</p>
<p>• <strong>Productivity Amplified</strong><br />
Dockerfiles are building bricks for <a href="../../ci-cd-services-integrate-and-automate-devops.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI/CD DevOps</a> pipelines as containers are quickly built and deployed. They outclass virtual machines on this front and gel well with the cloud-native architecture. The compatibility with <a href="../devops-managed-services-tap-the-true-potential-of-your-devops-transformation/devops.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> and cloud-native architecture lends the edge to developers to build robust packages excited about the quality.</p>
<p>• <strong>Seamlessness</strong><br />
While it was initially intended for Linux, Dockerfiles no longer bear the semblance of a typical Linux container as they are highly footloose. They are compatible with any platform and machine. They are gel well with any OS, and due to these aspects, Docker containers are incredibly seamless when it comes to movement and deployment across any installation.</p>
<p>• <strong>Modifications Simplified</strong><br />
Every Dockerfiles comes with a process that allows the developers to make it lightweight. This process allows developers to modify an application without taking it down to execute the changes. In other terms, the DevOps CI/CD pipeline members can effectively update the app at a granular level.</p>
<p>• <strong>Automation Bettered</strong><br />
Automation is one of the critical aspects of the digital world of today. Companies worldwide are implementing this to reduce human error and deploy updates better. There are various uses for automation, but the cloud has revolutionized it, and Docker complemented the cloud’s ambitious automation plans with dockerfiles. A docker can create a container with your application source code alone. Furthermore, it allows to recreate containers using the existing content as a foundation image template. You can also roll back easily as Docker also has a versioning system.</p>
<p>• <strong>Costs Management Improved</strong><br />
Money is one of the key aspects that decide any technology procurement. Most of the current IT technologies have taken cognizance of the significance of cost factors and have implemented pay-as-you-go models across their technological offerings. Cloud has made the made this pay-as-you-go model popular, which allows users to pay only for the resources, and it allows users to trim their capital expenditure.</p>
<p>Docker embraced the same spirit by allowing its users to ramp up production with a minimal spike in production. First off, the Docker is free to be used as it is open-source. That wicks away unwanted licensing headaches, and it is fluidic nature allows it to be used on any infrastructure.</p>
<p>Additionally, productivity is enhanced by running more code on each server. Finally, the accompanying benefits, such as automation, allow you to save expenses spent on manpower, further reducing costs. In a nutshell, Docker ensures cost savings without hampering product quality.</p>
<p>• <strong>Wide-spread Docker Community</strong><br />
It is no secret that open-source projects are prevalent among IT developers. Linux, which was developed as an open-source OS, has become one of the most widely used OS across the world. The same is the case with UNIX and Kubernetes. They are all kept alive by the growing contributions of developers. The contributions keep the application relevant, and open-source contribution encourages a widespread network of users to existing.</p>
<p>In addition, developers participate in discussions that propagate and pave the way for change, whether on forums or any platform. The same is the case with Docker, as it is also open-source, and you can access the user-uploaded containers to get your job done, should it suit your requirements. This saves time and money.</p>

<h2>Why Seek Docker Alternatives?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13888 size-full" title="Why Seek Docker Alternatives?" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/05/why-seek-docker-alternatives.png" alt="Why Seek Docker Alternatives?" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/why-seek-docker-alternatives.png 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/why-seek-docker-alternatives-300x225.png 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/why-seek-docker-alternatives-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>It may stupefy you why one would seek alternatives for Docker when there are so many benefits. After all, it is open-source, and it can be downloaded with no hassle. However, there is a substantial managerial populace looking for docker alternatives for specific reasons. So, let’s understand them better.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, Docker is not easy for all. It takes a certain amount of time to understand the intricacies of Docker. Additionally, it puts up a daunting learning curve for the novices. The open-source origins mean an overabundance of learning material out there, and the docker novices would have to wade through a lot of learning material to realize their business goals. This is one of the motivating reasons why companies seek the services of <strong>Veritis</strong> as we amassed enough expertise to tailor Docker and non-docker solutions.</p>
<p>The open-source intricacy also means that everything is not readily available. This throws up various issues which the administrators have to deal with. For example, for requirements that <strong>Docker</strong> does not meet, one would have to seek and integrate 3rd party tools to achieve what is wished. Also, one would have to store the data in another repository as persistent data storage is not an option with Docker.</p>
<p>Also, the expertise is back in the picture as it requires skills to configure and implement container orchestration. This aspect extends to orchestration tools which range from Docker Swarm to Apache Mesos. Although this blog is about Docker, the same applies to <a href="../../kubernetes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a> orchestration as it requires a lot of skillsets.</p>
<p>Finally, dockerfiles demand your energies to secure the layers, which are relatively more when come pitted against a regular stack. These factors bog down the docker adoption as training your in-house DevOps team on docker technology would be expensive and too complex without indulging in the learning courses. The net result would defeat the purpose of Docker. So, while the benefits of Docker are certainly enticing, the cons are reasons enough to motivate the managers to seek docker alternatives.</p>
<p>In the next section, we shall explore the docker alternatives. First, however, it would help if you understood that each comes with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. So, best to understand them properly before you embrace one of the alternatives. But, you should know that you are missing out on an opportunity by skipping docker technology, and if you have a chance, take your time and experience the benefits.</p>
<p>So, now, let’s dive into the next section without further ado.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Useful Link: <a href="../../future-of-devops-top-6-devops-trends-in-2022-and-beyond.html" target="_blank" rel="bookmark noopener">Top 6 DevOps Trends in 2022 and Beyond</a></strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>Alternative 1: Serverless Architecture</h3>
<p>Serverless architecture is gaining momentum as its benefits attract many organizations to adopt it instead of Docker. While serverless gives an impression that there is no server involved, serverless infrastructure implies no requirement or need to manage and maintain a server to execute an application.</p>
<p>The cloud vendor eliminates the requirement of maintenance of the server as he maintains the server. With these aspects out of the picture, the DevOps team can concentrate their energies on other aspects that demand their attention. As a result, the developers can work better with serverless architecture by deploying their applications with ease, be it coding or packaging. In addition, organizations can opt what backend services are required and deploy their solutions on the maintained servers.</p>
<p>As we have understood, serverless removes the problems and burgeoning aspects of maintenance by offloading all of those aspects to the <a href="../lack-cloud-expertise-cost-enterprises-250-million-annually/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud vendor</a>. There is no learning curve here, and there are no docker or container configuration intricacies. The additional benefits involve the organization not concerning itself with scalability issues and upgrade or update deployment as they are delivered faster and better to the market.</p>
<h3>Alternative 2: Virtual Machines (VMs) from VMware</h3>
<p>While it is a train of thought that VMWare will lose its relevance, it is not anytime soon. VMware continues to lead the race in the virtualization arena, and it is a good alternative for docker technology. The difference between Docker and VMware is that Docker focuses on the resources at the OS level while the latter makes virtualization possible on the hardware level.</p>
<p>VMware also brings along the vSphere suite that houses various tools required to make cloud virtualization possible. In addition, the vSphere is strong-armed by ESXi, allowing developers to run multiple operating systems on one host. Effectively, every OS gets to run with its dedicated resources.</p>
<h3>Alternative 3: Monolithic applications</h3>
<p>Monolithic applications are another alternative to Docker, which employ <a href="../../aws-vs-azure-vs-gcp-the-cloud-platform-of-your-choice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS, Azure, or GCP</a> virtual machines. Should you choose AWS, an AWS EC2 instance, you will get the basic OS components and other essentialities that you would need to get things going. Also, you can use AMI or Amazon Machine Image to create your unique VM in the same instance.</p>
<p>This AMI can be utilized for specific cases, and this would be enabled by developers who configure the AMI when they are running it in AWS. One can also use Amazon ECS for orchestration purposes. However, AMIs are not lightweight compared to dockers, which can be made lightweight.</p>
<h3>Alternative 4: Apache Mesos</h3>
<p>Apache is well-known among the IT community as it is popular for its open-source products. Apace Mesos is the same as it is an open-source container tool. It was developed by Apache Software Foundation and was formerly called Nexus. Coded with C++ language. The abstraction tool differentiates virtual resources from hardware and gives you the capabilities to run apps on it. You can also execute Kubernetes, Hadoop, and other such tools on Mesos.</p>
<h3>Alternative 5: Hashicorp’s Vagrant</h3>
<p>Hashicorp has made Vagrant open-source, and organizations have built and managed software deployment. It sports an intuitive workflow and facilitates automation. Vagrant users can automatically create mobile development ecosystems. You should adopt Vagrant if you are inclined to a compatible and easily usable software when you are not entirely reliant on microservices for your business.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Docker is a great tool, and so are the others listed here. However, every tool sports a small to the steep learning curve, which would set back every organization on time and other resources.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13876 size-full" title="Vertical Scaling Vs Horizontal Scaling" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vertical-scaling-vs-horizontal-scaling.jpg" alt="Vertical Scaling Vs Horizontal Scaling" width="800" height="422" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vertical-scaling-vs-horizontal-scaling.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vertical-scaling-vs-horizontal-scaling-300x158.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vertical-scaling-vs-horizontal-scaling-768x405.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Change is one of the critical aspects that decide an enterprise&#8217;s future. While change fosters growth, enterprises would either have to expend many resources or shed some of the non-essential systems. In the traditional business houses, coping with the change is a big deal as one would have to make the changes quickly, and that is not something that everyone can perform deftly.</p>
<p>To boil it down, the organizations would have to add or shed some of their servers to handle the change in demand. While this is a complex task for the traditional legacy business houses, enterprises that have integrated with <a href="../lack-cloud-expertise-cost-enterprises-250-million-annually/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud technology</a> experience seamless scaling technologies.</p>
<p>But, what is this scalability so strongly associated with cloud computing? Regardless of whichever sector you are in when dealing with the cloud, scalability is one of the aspects you keep encountering. And while scalability is what makes cloud outclass the traditional setups, there are certain intricacies involved.</p>
<p>In this blog, we shall explore scalability, what exactly these <strong>vertical and horizontal scalabilities</strong> are, and which one should go with.</p>
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<p>Whenever there is a peak stage, one would need more resources and instantly capitalize on the time. And once the demand peaks, the user will be left with unwanted resources, which would metaphorically collect dust. It is like having an unmown lawn in day-to-day life, and to maintain it, you get a lawnmower and restore the lawn to its beauty. But, once the job is done, you have to tuck away the lawnmower until the next mowing session.</p>
<p>Instead, you don’t have the lawnmower in the cloud, and you don’t wish to have it around unless you need it. You get to go ahead and borrow the tools from your neighbors to get the job done. Once the job’s done, you get to return it, and with that approach, you don’t have to own a resource that you only need during certain times.</p>
<p>The same is with the cloud, you need to rope in extra resources only when you need them, and you are required to pay up only for what you use. These resources can range from extra storage to additional RAM power. Effectively, scalability takes on resources when required and during lean periods, shedding unwanted resources to save monetary resources.</p>
<p>What makes cloud scalability lucrative for businesses is instant availability. While there are predictive spikes, there is always a sudden surprise spike in traffic, and it demands stunted latency without downtimes. Thankfully, <a href="../lack-cloud-expertise-cost-enterprises-250-million-annually/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud providers</a> make the required resources available within no time.</p>
<p>Now that scalability has been delved upon, let’s look at what vertical scaling and horizontal scaling are.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Vertical Scaling</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13877 size-full" title="Vertical Scaling" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vertical-scaling.jpg" alt="Vertical Scaling" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vertical-scaling.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vertical-scaling-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/vertical-scaling-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Vertical scaling refers to the up-scaling process where your infrastructure’s computational capacity is boosted to mitigate the new requirements. This process is also called scale-up, and it allows you to retain the resources in the existing logical unit. As a result, the infrastructure’s network capacity, storage power, and processing ability will be expanded.</p>
<h2>Horizontal Scaling</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13874 size-full" title="Horizontal Scaling" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/05/horizontal-scaling.jpg" alt="Horizontal Scaling" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/horizontal-scaling.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/horizontal-scaling-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/horizontal-scaling-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The computational power and devices are pulled into the picture in horizontal scaling. Here, you add more devices and distribute the existing computational capacity over the existing and additional devices. So while there won’t be a spike in computational power, the devices across your infrastructure would increase. This distribution is what makes separates horizontal scaling from vertical scaling. It is also called scaling out.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Vertical Scaling vs. Horizontal Scaling</h2>
<p>Although scalability is mainly associated with computational power, the hardware is the key aspect that sets horizontal scaling apart from vertical scaling. The hardware configuration is enhanced in vertical scaling without disturbing or modifying the logical unit. The hardware specifications remain the same in horizontal scaling while the number of instances spikes up. In other words, the hardware infrastructure is increased by adding more devices with the same specifications.</p>
<p>The other aspect they differ upon is that a sequential piece of logic is broken into smaller units and implemented on multiple devices in horizontal scaling. The breakup of the code allows programmers to execute multiple tasks parallelly over different devices. This is not the case with vertical scaling, as the logic code remains unchanged. The unchanged code is run across the boosted infrastructure. With the differences out of the way, let’s look at the advantages of both the scaling methods.</p>
<h3>Pros and cons of Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling</h3>
<p>As with everything, both the scaling methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Both approaches differ, particularly on code and hardware. There is no code change involved in vertical scaling; it is much easier to execute than horizontal scaling. The operations are easier to manage, and the data is centered upon one node.</p>
<p>This centralized node allows you to run the operations across multiple devices. In addition, the expenses are reduced in vertical scaling as your infrastructure footprint isn’t increased. This boils down to the company not dedicating extra monetary resources for power consumption and cooling units. Additionally, managing the network from the nodal device is more straightforward and better from the control point.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of vertical scaling is that your hardware can only expand up to a specific limit. Though one can always boost the hardware on certain aspects, the scope to expand it holistically narrows down significantly. Also, one would have to shut down the required devices whenever they are scaling up, resulting in downtime. Additionally, the nodal device has to be taken care of as unexpected downtimes from that device would stunt productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal scaling</strong> scores well on these aspects as one just adds on additional devices to consume the existing power. There is no downtime involved, and you can choose how many devices you choose. Additionally, the nodal control mechanism doesn’t exist in this scaling approach, and this betters resilience. However, it runs aground on the data aspect. The data must be partitioned into multiple units due to the existence of multiple devices. This partition also complicates data sharing and processing.</p>

<h3>Deciding Factors</h3>
<p>With both approaches scoring over each other, it boils to a few crucial aspects which help you decide which one you should go with.</p>
<h4><strong>Costs Involved</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Vertical scaling</strong> requires you to spend at the onset of the adoption itself. You will pay for the higher power, and effectively, it fares well in the initial stages. In horizontal scaling, you wouldn’t have to pay up much at the onset of the scaling process. You would be required to pay up for the devices when you opt for them, but later on, your cost overheads would crop up in the form of cooling systems and space requirements.</p>
<h4>Clientele</h4>
<p><strong>Horizontal scaling</strong> allows you to circumvent latencies and outages. You don’t have to shut down the servers to implement the scaling process. Should the customer base be localized and if the burgeoning requirements demand higher processing power, it would be better to adopt a vertical scaling process. As the latencies and outages are involved, your clientele should be okay with such aspects.</p>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<p><strong>Vertical scaling</strong> reduces your flexibility to a certain extent as today&#8217;s technology would limit you. In this approach, you wouldn’t have the freedom to choose whatever you wish. In horizontal scaling, you can choose the required configuration and optimize operational costs.</p>

<h3>Trouble Deciding?</h3>
<p>While it seems the choice is easy to make, scaling is decided by your infrastructure’s architecture and other factors. Also, you should realize that vertical and horizontal scaling is not a choice one should always make. One can implement both the scaling processes and reap the benefits of it.</p>
<p>While it sounds easy, improper scaling would stunt your production process and demand higher monetary resources. To avoid this, Fortune 500 companies and emerging companies have roped in <a href="../../www_veritis_default_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veritis</a> to better their production processes.</p>

<p>In this modern-day generation, CIOs are soliciting IT professionals to provide an effective data platform that supports machine learning and data-driven innovation. Moreover, they also want to continue supporting data reports and traditional business intelligence tools. Successful ones find the solution for these needs without making trade-offs while appreciating the strengths of data warehouses.</p>
<p>A data warehouse is a central repository for a business to share and analyze the data to guide strategic decisions. To make productive data driven decisions, the data should be free of outliers, cropped results, and user mistakes. An organization can use data-driven evidence to choose which products to build, pursue growth initiatives, and add features. Essentially, the data warehouse can provide insight and intelligence that lead to competitive advantages and new opportunities.</p>
<p>While a plethora of data warehouses available in the current market, <strong>Amazon Redshift</strong> and <strong>Azure Synapse </strong>Analysis stand out as the top contenders. However, choosing the right vendor between Amazon Redshift and Azure Synapse is an arduous task as both offer a lot of advantages. In this blog, we shall guide you and help you choose the best provider for your platform.</p>
<p>Before delving into the major differences between the top two <a href="../lack-cloud-expertise-cost-enterprises-250-million-annually/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud platforms</a>, we will introduce you to a data warehouse, Amazon Redshift, and Azure Synapse Analytics.</p>
<h2>What is a Data Warehouse?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13849 size-full" title="What is a Data Warehouse?" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/05/what-is-data-warehouses.jpg" alt="What is a Data Warehouse?" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/what-is-data-warehouses.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/what-is-data-warehouses-300x150.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/what-is-data-warehouses-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>As mentioned, A data warehouse (DWH) is a central reserve of information that can be extracted from operational sources and external data sources to produce business insights. It is typically used for data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence (BI). Data stored in the DWH is entirely different from data discovered in the operational environment.</p>
<p>DWH makes it easy to quickly analyze business data extracted from operational systems such as inventory management systems, point-of-sale systems, and marketing databases. Information gathered from transactional databases is hard enough to generate the data directly as it can gather through the data warehouse. For instance, an organization wants to know the total revenue produced by each salesperson for each product every month. Transactional databases may not generate this data, but the DWH can produce it.</p>
<h3>Amazon Redshift &#8211; Cloud Data Warehouses</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13837 size-full" title="Amazon Redshift" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amazon-redshift.jpg" alt="Amazon Redshift" width="800" height="457" srcset="https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amazon-redshift.jpg 800w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amazon-redshift-300x171.jpg 300w, https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amazon-redshift-768x439.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><strong>Amazon Redshift</strong> is a data warehouse solution that enables business intelligence in the <strong>AWS cloud</strong>. Redshift allows customers to query petabytes of semi-structured and structured data using standard SQL queries. It is used for analysis and large-scale data storage, and Redshift frequently allows large-scale database migrations.</p>
<p>Users can start small with no commitments and scale up to petabytes or more. It allows them to operate their data to obtain new sights for their customers and business. Redshift is a fully managed solution that automates the most common administrative tasks associated with security, configuration, and maintaining backups, among others.</p>
<p>The Amazon Redshift data warehouse consists of computing resources called nodes in a cluster. Each cluster uses its Redshift engine with at least one database and performs data analytics queries. Nodes can be deactivated and activated based on the requirement so that enterprises can use from gigabytes to petabyte-level storage in minutes.</p>
<p>Amazon Redshift stores data securely, offering companies insights into nearly every aspect of their enterprise, from sales and marketing to website performance. AWS touts that Amazon Redshift is the world’s fastest cloud data warehouse service and has three times better price-performance than other vendors.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>Amazon Redshift data warehouse is one of the cost-effective solutions that you need to pay only for what you consume. AWS charges USD 0.25 with no upfront and no commitment costs, and users can scale up to USD 250 per terabyte per year.</p>
<p>The cost of Amazon Redshift varies from one region to another. To put in perspective, the cost in US East (Ohio) would be.</p>

<p><strong>Azure Synapse</strong> Analytics is an unlimited information analysis service that combines the capabilities of enterprise data warehousing, big data analytics, ETL pipelines, analytics tools and services, visualization and dashboards, and data integration. It allows you to query data on your requirements, using either provisioned resources or serverless at scale.</p>
<p>Azure Synapse permits a single service for all workloads when managing, serving, and processing data for data protection and immediate business intelligence requirements. Features like data pipelines (powered by Azure data factory), data flow creation, data ingestion, data exploration, and data visualization are available in a single place. In addition, performance optimization and workload monitoring are part of the package.</p>
<p>Apache Spark pools are also available in Azure Synapse. This tool is one of the favourite tools for data scientists and data engineers, thanks to handling machine learning capabilities, compatibility and extensive data.</p>
<p>The design and architecture of the Azure Synapse data warehouse depend on multiple factors. A well-performing data warehouse should guarantee low latency, concurrency, data availability, and the ability to incorporate with other systems.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>In terms of pricing, Azure Synapse offers a pay-as-you-go model. You pay only you consume for the services. However, prices can be higher than in the pre-purchasing model. Currently, it offers two versions – Azure Synapse Analytics which allows only data warehousing, and the next one is the new Azure Synapse Analytics pre-purchase plan.</p>
<p>In the current market, the pricing models for serverless and dedicated consumption are</p>
<h3>Dedicated</h3>
<p>The cost of a dedicated version varies from one region to another. To put in perspective, the cost in the central US would be.</p>
